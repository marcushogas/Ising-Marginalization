# Toy Example

This folder contains minimal working examples illustrating the **Ising-marginalization** method introduced in  
*“Analytic Marginalization over Binary Variables in Physics Data” (Högås et al., 2025).*
Demonstrates a linear model with independent and correlated data to test the Ising method’s accuracy and efficiency.
The code includes advanced numerical features beyond the needs of the toy examples, allowing easy extension to more complex applications.
