# Toy Example

This folder contains minimal working examples illustrating the **Ising-marginalization** method introduced in  
*“Analytic Marginalization over Binary Variables in Physics Data” (Högås et al., 2025).*
It implements a linear model and includes two illustrative cases—independent and correlated data—demonstrating the accuracy and efficiency of the Ising-marginalization method.
Many of the numerical features implemented in the code are "overkill" but included for straightforward adaptation to more advanced application.
