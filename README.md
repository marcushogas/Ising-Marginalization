# Ising-Marginalization
Marginalization over binary variables — mapping statistical data analysis problems to the Ising model.

This repository accompanies the paper *"Analytic Marginalization over Binary Variables in Physics Data"* (Högås et al., 2025) and provides example notebooks illustrating the method and its applications.

## Contents
- **Toy_Example.ipynb** – minimal working demonstration of the Ising-marginalization formalism.  
- **SNIa_Calibration.ipynb** – mock Type Ia supernova analysis mimicking the Pantheon+ sample, showing how the Ising approach handles uncertainty in host-galaxy mass classification. 

## Overview
The Ising-marginalization method allows analytic treatment of discrete or binary nuisance parameters without exponentially scaling computational cost. It reformulates the likelihood correction as the log-partition function of an Ising model, enabling efficient marginalization and a clear physical interpretation of correlations and priors.
